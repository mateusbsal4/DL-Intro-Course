# Introduction to Deep Learning Exercises 

This repository contains the code for the "Introduction to Deep Learning" lecture at TUM. The exercises primarily focus on Computer Vision tasks, exploring various neural network architectures ranging from well-known fully connected networks to CNNs and fully convolutional networks.

Initially, NumPy is used to implement backpropagation in a more comprehensive manner. For the latter tasks, PyTorch is utilized.
